## Bitcoin in Rust

bitcoin_in_rust is a Bitcoin implementation with the focus on teaching the core concepts and functionalities using the Rust programming language. It's inspired by the book "Programming Bitcoin" by Jimmy Song., available [here](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-bitcoin/9781492031482/). 

### Goals and Objectives

- **Understand Bitcoin**: Deepen the understanding of Bitcoin's underlying technology as presented in "Programming Bitcoin".
- **Rust Programming**: Leverage Rust's features for building safe and efficient Bitcoin-related applications.
- **Open Sourcen**: Provide a resource for others interested in Bitcoin and Rust, facilitating learning and community.

### Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Install Rust: Ensure you have Rust installed on your machine. If not, follow the instructions at [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
   - Basic Understanding of Bitcoin: Familiarity with Bitcoin concepts as covered in "Programming Bitcoin" is recommended.

2. **Installation**:
   - Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/HermanObst/bitcoin_in_rust.git
     ```
   - Navigate to the project directory and build:
     ```bash
     cd bitcoin_in_rust
     cargo build
     ```
